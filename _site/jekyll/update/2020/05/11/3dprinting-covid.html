    <h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>I’ve followed the development of 3D printing fairly closely over the past few years, but grew interested enough in it in 2019 to make it a part of my undergraduate dissertation.</p>

<p>Using Computer Vision tools, I used a model based approach to recreate a human head, so that it could be 3D printed. I’ll spare you most of the detail, but it didn’t work very well.</p>

<p><img src="../../../../../resources/3dheadprint.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="covid19-and-ppe">Covid–19 and PPE</h2>

<p>When the astonishing lack of preparedness on the part of the UK government first became aware to me I wasn’t surprised. I’ve been a <em>Raving Momentum Stalinist Trotskyist Corbynite Marxist Thug</em> for the past few years, so I’m all too aware of the Conservative government’s lack of shits regarding the health service.</p>

<p>For the uninitiated, frontline healthcare staff didn’t have enough masks, face shields, or scrubs. The ones they did have were out of date, often by years. The government then <em>chose</em> not to opt into a massive Europe wide operation to procure PPE.</p>

<p>I wanted to help, and as luck would have it a video popped up in my Facebook  news feed. A local man was using his 3D printers to manufacture face shields, I got in touch, and then ordered my own printer and some filament, how hard could it be to get started?</p>

<p><img src="../../../../../resources/printer-assembly.jpg" alt="" title="Assembling the printer" /></p>

<p>I ordered a Creality Ender-5, and got to work.</p>

<p>There were some teething problems…
<img src="../../../../../resources/printerhotend.jpg" alt="" title="Teething problems" /></p>

<p>The bed levelling procedure took a while to master, but with that done I was off to the races! (Not Cheltenham)</p>

<h2 id="face-shields">Face Shields</h2>

<p>The most useful thing I could produce was face shields. I could print a disposable headband in around 20 minutes, to which I would staple a sheet of acrylic.</p>

<p>These seemed great in theory, but after some provisioinal feedback from the ambulance service, stating they would fall apart in a small breeze, we moved onto more structurally sound designs.</p>

<p><img src="../../../../../resources/orange-white-production.jpg" alt="" title="Disposables" /></p>

<p>The following design is what has been come to known as a Verkstan, after the <a href="https://3dverkstan.se">Swedish 3D printing firm</a>.</p>

<p><img src="../../../../../resources/blueproduction.jpg" alt="" title="Verkstan Visor" /></p>

<p>These are <strong>far</strong> better than the disposable design, and have recieved much better feedback from frontline healthcare staff.</p>

<p>I’m currently producing around 10 of these a day. It’s a drop in the ocean compared to what’s required, but I know it’s helping.</p>

<h2 id="mutual-aid">Mutual Aid</h2>
<p>I couldn’t do this alone, and since the beginning have been part of a maker community that is now also producing scrubs and face masks.</p>

<p>These are all being distributed for free to those who need it through our online portal.</p>

<h2 id="fin"><em>fin</em></h2>
<p>I’ve really rushed this post, and it probably makes no sense, but wanted to fill up the white space on my blog hompage.</p>

<p>Hope you enjoyed it, solidarity forever.</p>
